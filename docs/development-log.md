Write TWO status updates on your application. You must write a status update when:
- you significantly change a feature or your implementation plan at any point

- encounter a significant issue, challenge or roadblock
- are halfway through implementing the features
- prior to / after testing the application
--------
You should submit these logs throughout the course of developing your application.

Each status report should be between 100 - 200 words.

The Development Log should be written in markdown and placed in a file named development-log.md in the root of your source control repository. Ensure you put the date of the log at the top of each log entry.

Please send your log to your educator as a markdown file as you complete them. This is so we can provide you with feedback.


Day 1 - 20/04/20

- drafted up the control flow diagram
- sent idea to educators for approval. Many initial features considered for inclusion into the library: users can list books by genre, maybe 5 genres, they can list books by type (ebook, audiobook, hardcopy), they can borrow books but have a limit of 10 books allowed in their account, can return books, can view their account status, maybe multiple users with login names with login details stored in a seperate file so library can remember people's account status, etc
- drafted setup of trello space
- created docs in folder
- talked to lavanya about idea and she made suggestions for how to keep it simple


Day 2 - 21/04/20 (add pics etc proof)
- idea approved by Janel and she made suggestions for keeping it simple
- decided what is MVP necessary and what is additional - decided on simple features to begin with - no "hold" feature on non available vs available books, no multiple users, less genres, only 1 type of books for now (hardcopy)
- did first version of digital control flow diagram, but this will change as I add more features
- chatted one on one to Varsha and Lavanya about my idea and clarified user stories/main features
- got some clarity on docs and implementation plan: readme is like a bible, implementation plan is basically trello, lots of docs not needed but they are specified in rubric
- finished setup of trello space, but this will change as I develop the app
- talked to Lavanya and Varsha about app idea, key features, user stories, how i should keep it simple
- wrote up basic software development plan markup file, this will continue to change and be updated
- updated the log
- first git commit

Day 3 - 22/04/20
- Varsha went over deliverables section on canvas - we previously couldnt see this - this made what documents required easier - I had previously gone over the rubric and made 4 markdown files: development-log, help, testing (for scripts), software development log (the main readme). Need to have all these in general readme.md file or linked to from that file. makes it clearer!
