Write TWO status updates on your application. You must write a status update when:
- you significantly change a feature or your implementation plan at any point

- encounter a significant issue, challenge or roadblock
- are halfway through implementing the features
- prior to / after testing the application
--------
You should submit these logs throughout the course of developing your application.

Each status report should be between 100 - 200 words.

The Development Log should be written in markdown and placed in a file named development-log.md in the root of your source control repository. Ensure you put the date of the log at the top of each log entry.

Please send your log to your educator as a markdown file as you complete them. This is so we can provide you with feedback.
