Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application and written in markdown.

write scripts to run tests
